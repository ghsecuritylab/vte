				'dt' To Do List:
				----------------

     o	Rewrite test scripts to use Tcl (as opposed to 'csh').

     o	Consider adding support for testing pseudo-terminals (ptys).

     o	Consider adding support for testing via threads packages.
	- for systems without AIO, mimic AIO via threads.

     o	Consider adding support to test streams, System V shared memory,
	and POSIX message queues.

     o	Add scripting capability to allow users to roll-your-own tests.

     o	Add ability for single 'dt' process to test multiple devices.
