Description:  This log file shows an example of using the "volumes="
and "vrecords=" options.  Basically, we will write 2 volumes, with 100
records being written on the last (2nd) volume.  This option is useful
when you don't know the capacity of the media, or when data compression
affects the total capacity, like it does with most tapes.  Please also
notice the new logic when requesting volumes... errors are now detected
and the user has the option of retrying, rather than exiting with a
failure on this lengthy test.  Enjoy, Robin.
