	QNX Specific Notes:
	-------------------
     o	The Makefile is setup for building 'dt' using the flat memory
	model.  This can be changed to compact model for running on
	non-32bit QNX systems (also remove -D_QNX_32BIT).

     o	There are numerous 'dt' scripts used to help automate testing,
	but they were written to use C-Shell which is not shipped with
	QNX.  I downloaded 'tcsh' from QUICS, which appears to work Ok.
	[ BTW:  None of these scripts are required to run 'dt'. ]

     o	Some 'dt' tests are not built into the QNX version at this
	time, since these features are not currently supported.  This
	includes POSIX AIO (-DAIO), memory mapped files (-DMMAP), and
	tape specific tests (in dttape.c), which require the MTIOCTOP
	ioctl() command.

	Finally upgraded to QNX 4.2 and built 'dt' with Watcom 9.52 compiler
kit.  The default build is flat memory model, for 32-bit systems.

	Fixed problem waiting for child processes.  Turns out, POSIX allows
SIGCHLD to be handled differently depending on SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL setting.
For QNX, SIGCHLD signal had to be set to SIG_DFL to work properly for 'dt'.

	The "files=" option can only be used to read multiple tape files,
since no support exists for writing file marks in this version of 'dt'.  I
haven't actually tested this on QNX tape devices, since I don't have any,
but it has been tested on SunOS, ULTRIX, and DEC OSF/1 systems.

	The scripts supplied with 'dt' are written to use C-shell, but work
just fine with 'tcsh' which is available on QUICS.  I just create a link
from 'tcsh' to 'csh' in /bin.  Some of the scripts may need changed a little
to run properly on QNX, since they were written for BSD-Unix like systems.
They should serve as good templates however, incase you're not a shell script
writing expert (neither am I).
