1.0  GENERAL DESCRIPTION:

     This specification defines the detail requirements for the general, 
     physical, data structure, and electrical requirements for the Compact 
     Disc Read Only Memory (CDROM), 4.7 inch (120 mm) diameter, replicated 
     disc. The requirements herein are applicable to the purchase of new 
     discs only, except where otherwise indicated. The disc is intended 
     specifically for use with compact disc players employing read only 
     memory laser technology and constant linear velocity.

3.0  REQUIREMENTS:
     
     Discs shall meet all ECMA-130 Specifications. In addition, discs 
     manufactured for DIGITAL shall meet the following criteria:

3.1   Mechanical:

3.1.1   Disk Outer Edge Specification: The outside surface of the disc may 
        be either beveled or cylindrical.

        If the outside surface of the disk is cylindrical, it must not 
        contain a lip on the label edge of the disc, as shown in the 
        following diagram:

               Label Side
             ------------------------------------
           Center Hole                        |   \
             ---------------------------------     \
                                                  Outer Edge Showing Lip
        
        If this lip is present, the disc may stick or jam in a DIGITAL 
        drive during normal use.

        Disks can be tested for this condition by examining the outer edge 
        with an appropriate tool to visually inspect for the presence or 
        absence of a lip. If the labeled side is more than 30 microns 
        larger in diameter than the unlabeled side, the disc shall be said 
        to contain a lip.

3.2   Electrical:

3.2.1   Recording Format:  DIGITAL shall use only the mode 1 recording 
        format as specified in the ECMA-130 standard.

3.2.2   Maximum Bytes of Storage per Disc:  Discs shall not be manufactured 
        with more than 72 minutes of playing time. This translates into no 
        more than 635 megabytes of digital data storage using mode 1 
        recording format.
3.3   Performance:

        Performance measurements are based on "as manufactured" quality,       
        and do not include user induced errors.
        
3.3.1   Raw Error Rate on Manufactured Discs:

        The frame error rate as specified in ECMA-130, section 12.5.2,
        averaged over any 10 second interval, shall be less than 3 X 102. 

3.3.2   Level 3 Uncorrectable Errors on the Master:  

        There shall be no level 3 uncorrectable errors on the father as 
        played on the master player during the mastering process. 

3.3.3   Level 3 Uncorrectable Errors on Manufactured Discs:

        There shall be no uncorrectable level 3 errors on discs produced. 
        This measurement shall be taken from a statistically valid sample 
        of production discs.

3.3.4   3 Bit Errors in the C2 Decoder (E32) on the Manufactured Discs:
        
        There shall be no more than 5% of any particular manufacturing lot 
        with an E32 count greater than 0. This measurement shall be taken 
        from a statistically valid sample of production discs.

        An E32 error causes invocation of level 3 ECC, which degrades
        performance greatly. A number of errors on any one disc will render 
        that disc unuseable by DIGITAL and it's customers due to 
        performance degradation.

        It shall be understood by DIGITAL and its vendors that a goal of 
        zero errors shall be the objective. It shall be the responsibility 
        of DIGITAL and vendor manufacturing to keep the error count per 
        disc and per batch as low as possible.
        
3.3.5   Linear Velocity:  Discs shall be mastered such that the linear 
        velocity shall not be lower than 1.25 meters per second.

3.3.6   Track Pitch:  Nominal track pitch consistent with maximum data 
        reliability shall be used in all cases when mastering discs.

3.3.7   Aging:  Discs shall be manufactured for an expected life time of 10 
        years under normal use.

3.4   Test Discs:

      30-23507-02 and 30-23507-03 are test discs for the RRD50 and the 
      RRD40, respectively. Information on test disc data patterns, CDROM 
      disc structure, and the macro program used to generate data patterns 
      are found in the DIGITAL engineering specification A-SP-RRD40-0-DBT. 
      Information on the RRD40 test disc specifications are in Appendix A 
      of A-PS-3023507-0-0. The major differences between the two test discs 
      are as follows:

      1. Logical Block Number 0 (00:02:00) has a slightly different header.

      2. The RRD50 test disc has a forced error at sectors 64:55:73 and 
         64:55:74 while the RRD40 test disc has a number of forced errors 
         occurring in the disc range from 60:00:00 minutes to the end of 
         the disc. (This is described in Appendix A.)

      3. There is slightly less capacity on the RRD40 test disc.

      APPLICATION NOTE: The CD disc uses the Minute:Second:Frac (mm:ss:ff) 
      format.

         One Logical Block Number (LBN) contains 512 bytes of data.
         One frame contains four LBNs.
         One second contains 75 fracs.
         One minute contains 60 seconds.

      The first sector of the test disc is composed on LBNs 0, 1, 2, and 3. 
      LBNs 0-3 are located at 00::02::00 on the disk in mm:ss:ff format.

                      RRD40 TEST DISC SPECIFICATIONS

                                30-23507-03


1.0  DATA PATTERNS:

     Use RRD40 data patterns, specified in A-SP-RRD40-0-DBT:

1.1  Revision B Mastering Parameters:

       Track Pitch:       1.55 microns
       Scan Speed:        1.25 meters/sec.

1.2  Revision C Mastering Parameters:

       Track Pitch:       1.6 microns 
       Scan Speed         1.3 meters/sec.                                  

1.3  If a new master must be created for any reason, it should be created 
     using the revision B track pitch and linear velocity. The revision of 
     the disc should be updated on the label. All new masters for this disc 
     require requalification by DIGITAL to verify proper function in the 
     RRD40. 

2.0  ERROR CHARACTERISTICS:

2.1  Revision B:

       Burst Error:       2.0 microseconds +/- 2%
       Duty Cycle:        34% +/- 2%
       Dropout Length:    0.70 microseconds +/- 2%                         

2.2  Revision C:

       The mastered errors must be of sufficient size to be flagged as     
       uncorrectable C2 errors by the RRD40, but shall not cause detracking
       or other player errors.

     There must be at least one error conforming to the above error
     characteristics between 62:00:00 and 62:10:00. Error placement
     in the reminder of the Forced Error section is unspecified.

4.0  SEQUENTIAL DATA PATTERNS:

     There are 10 data patterns in sequential order that are repeated for 
     the entire disc. These patterns are fully defined in A-SP-RRD40-0-DBT.

     0.  Sector x:x0:xx - 75 sectors of psuedo-random pattern2

     1.  Sector x:x1:xx - 75 sectors of psuedo-random pattern3 alternating 
                          with 0's sector

     2.  Sector x:x2:xx - 75 sectors of all 0s. *

     3.  Sector x:x3:xx - 75 sectors of all 1s (FFH)

     4.  Sector x:x4:xx - 75 sectors of 16 bit shifting 1 in a field of 0s 

     5.  Sector x:x5:xx - 75 sectors of 16 bit shifting 0 in a field of 1s.

     6.  Sector x:x6:xx - 75 sectors of alternating 01 pattern (AAH)

     7.  Sector x:x7:xx - 75 sectors of byte incrementing (OOH - FFH)

     8.  Sector x:x8:xx - 75 sectors of encrypted data pattern 

     9.  Sector x:x9:xx - 75 sectors of psuedo-random pattern1 alternating 
                          with 0's sector 
     NOTES: 

     x      Indicates any valid value for the CD address in 
            Minute:Second:Frame (mm:ss:ff) format.

     *      Sector 00:02:00 has the DIGITAL disc header on it. The 
            difference between the RRD50 test disc and the RRD40 test disc 
            is that the RRD40 will indicate that it is an "RRD40 TEST DISC" 
            and will have a "REV 2.0" revision, Reference A-SP-RRD40-0-DBT.
