Kernel patches:
===============
 - linux-L26.1.5-gcov-2.6.5.patch
        This is the original gcov-2.6.5.patch adapted to L26_1_5
        kernel tree.
 - linux-L26.1.5-gcov-arm.patch
        This one add gcov support for ARM architecture
 - linux-L26.1.5-gcov-mxc.patch
        This one add gcov support to MXC architectures
 - linux-L26.1.5-gcov-read_proc.patch
        This (very) ugly one fix (turnaround) a kernel freeze when
        reading /proc gcov entries   
 - linux-L26.1.5-gcov-vpath.patch
        This one fix a VPATH build problem with gcov-2.6.5.patch
 - linux-L26.1.5-gcov-freescale.patch
        This one add a "Profile all freescale drivers" option to the
        build process

Target scripts:
===============
 Due to the lack of perl support on the target, lcov tools can't be
used on it, so these scripts do the job:
 - lcov-capture.sh: capture coverage data on target
 - lcov-reset.sh: reset coverage counter on target.
 - lcovize-runtest.sed: add lcov support to an LTP runtest file.

Host scripts:
=============
 There are 2 wrapper scripts that can be used to process target's
coverage data:
 - vte-lcov.sh: run lcov on tar'ed coverage data (and fix busybox's
tar problems)
 - vte-genhtml.sh: a very simple wrapper script to genhtml.
